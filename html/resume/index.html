	<h1>Profile</h1>

    <p>
		I'm a lifelong learner who is continuously looking to learn and improve on processes. Instead of solving the same problems repeatedly, I seek lasting
		solutions. I enjoy all parts of the web stack - from improving server maintenance scripts to solving scaling problems on successful projects. My search
		for improvement extends to a passion for people and desire to see them grow, whether that’s helping inform and teach clients to challenging and
		assisting teammates. I want to be a part of a team that doesn’t settle but desires to grow in quality and in their abilities. Being challenged is
		welcomed as well as being able to learn new technologies and patterns to offer insight into existing ones. I strive for a balance in life and spend time
		away from work with my beautiful wife and daughter. Other interests are reading, making delicious food, and trying to play guitar.
