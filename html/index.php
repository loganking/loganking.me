			<h1>Hello!</h1>
			<p>I'm Logan King, a web developer whose passion for people follows through to making usable, accessible sites.</p>
			<p>Each project is hand-crafted using only the finest html, css, php, and javascript. I also dabble with both illustration and photography.</p>
			<p>Currently I'm employed by <a href="http://www.rocketjones.com">Rocket Jones Interactive</a> as a Technical Developer. I'm constantly looking to learn more and better my craft; for this current season that means learning as much as I can from the awesome Rocket Jones team while also working on some personal projects.</p>
			<p>Have a smaller project or job you think I'd be interested in? <a href="mailto:logan@loganking.me">Shoot me an email.</a></p>
